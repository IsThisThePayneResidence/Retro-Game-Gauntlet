# Retro Game Gauntlet
This is a simple application for rolling games for the 'Retro Game Gauntlet' challenge written in C++ using Qt (QML, JavaScript).
It's just a game roller now, but I'm going to add logging/history features (actually the features are almost done they're just commented, lol. Sorry)
